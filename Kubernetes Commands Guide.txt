pushing the image to the docker hub:
1: login first: "docker login" command
2. Go to https://hub.docker.com/
3. Sign in
4. Create a repository, make sure it's set to public to be able to pull
5. after creating the repo, you can now proceed to tagging the local image you have to push it: use the command below:

docker tag jasmin/posts:0.0.8 innkjsmn/posts:0.0.8

jasmin/posts:0.0.8 => is the docker image i have locally
innkjsmn/posts:0.0.8 => is what I am pushing to the docker hub

- make sure to re-check the image you have in the yaml file because what it's getting is not anymore locally but from the dockerhub
Note: you can put whatever version you like, latest is better for pulling for future use.
